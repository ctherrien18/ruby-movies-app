This is Callen, Landry, and Mario's 480 Ruby Project.

Our project allows users to search for their favorite movies using an API called OMDB API, 
which utilizes the popular website IMDB to query the users request from the input text box. 
This web application also allows users to create an account so they can keep track of the their 
favorite movies by adding them to their list, and others can also view their list of movies.
